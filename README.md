  - Your report should accompany your code. 
  - Include a word/pdf file in the repository.
  - In your report also decribe the following points
  
    a. What are the parameters that influence your algorithm? Explain their effect?
    
    b. Does one of the fitting models work better than the othet. Explain?
    
    c. What is the objective of this implementations? Which model works best and what are their parameters? Explain?
  
  -------------

Three sets of images are provided for testing
OpenCV: You can use opencv functions to load, display images.

Make sure your final submission is running on circleci. 
The TA will use CircleCI output and your github code for grading. 
TA will not be able to grade if the code does not run on circle CI.

Common reasons for failure.

Do not use any 3rd party libraries or functions.
Do not display images in your final submission. 
Example, cv2.imshow(), cv2.waitkey(), cv2.NamedWindow will make the circle ci fail.

PS. Files not to be changed: requirements.txt and .circleci directory 
If you do not like the structure, you are welcome to change the over all code, under two stipulations:

1. the homework has to run using command

  python cv_hm2.py -i1 image1 i2 image 2 -m TL -t 20,
  python cv_hm2.py -i1 image1 i2 image 2 -m RO it 20
  and
  python cv_hm2.py -i1 image1 i2 image 2 -m GA -t 20
 

  
2. Any output file or image should be written to output/ folder

The TA will only be able to see your results if these two conditions are met

1. Data Points         - 1 Pts.
2. Plotting            - 1 Pts.
3. Total Least Squares - 4 Pts
4. Robust Fitting      - 3 Pts
5. Gaussian Fitting    - 4 Pts
6. Report              - 2 Pts

    Total              - 15 Pts.
